# 🎮 Connect 4 AI — by Jeroen Penders

A console-based **Connect 4 game** written in Python, featuring a **heuristic AI** powered by the **Minimax algorithm** with **alpha-beta pruning**.  
The game supports both **Player vs Player** and **Player vs Computer** modes, with adjustable difficulty levels.

## 💡 Background

This project began as a personal challenge to implement real AI decision-making in a classic game.  
It started simple — a playable Connect 4 — and evolved into a full algorithmic experiment with game-state evaluation, recursion, and heuristic scoring.

It was one of my first deeper algorithmic projects, and it taught me a lot about how computers can simulate “thinking.”
